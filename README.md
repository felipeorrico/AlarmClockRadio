# Alarm Clock and Radio
Code and schematics for an Alarm clock and Radio developed using an ATMega 128 and Embedded C programming.

## This project was developed as an assignment for the Fall 2021 ECE473 (Microcontroller system design) course at Oregon State University.
## The goal of this project was to design and develop a system for the Mega128 microcontroller that implements an alarm clock with radio and temperature measurement capabilities.
### We were given a 2x16 LCD display, 1 ATMega 128 board, 9 LEDs, 8 Pushbutton Switches, 2 digital encoders, 1 radio board, 1 post-amplifier audio board, 1 LMC6032IN amplifier, 2 speakers, and 1 LM73 temperature sensor.
